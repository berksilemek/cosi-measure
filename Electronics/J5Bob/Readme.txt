Please note that for COSI Measure we use the source-enable option of the J5-Bob (for more info: https://github.com/modmaker/J5-BOB) 
So you need to add R1 (3k3 1/4W axial leaded resistor, e.g. MRS25) and 
Q2 (BC557B or other general purpose PNP transistor) to the J5-Bob baseboard 
and short the SRCE connection (see also photo).
